      summary: Prepare a DataFlow
      description: |
        The `prepare` request signals to the [=Data Plane=] to initialize a [=Data Flow=] and any resources required for
        data transfer. The request results in a state machine transition to PREPARING or PREPARED. If the state machine
        transitions to PREPARING, the [=Data Plane=] MUST return HTTP 202 Accepted with the `Location` header set to the
        [data flow status relative URL](#status) and a message body containing a `DataFlowResponseMessage`. If the state
        machine transitions to PREPARED, the [=Data Plane=] MUST return HTTP 200 OK and a `DataFlowResponseMessage`.

        The `started` request signals to the consumer [=Data Plane=] that a data transmission has begun. For pull
        transfers this indicates the consumer [=Data Plane=] may transmit data. For push transfers this
        indicates the provider has already begun sending data. The request results in a state machine transition to
        STARTED and the Data Plane MUST return HTTP 200 OK and a `DataFlowResponseMessage`.

        return HTTP 202 Accepted with the `Location` header set to the [data flow status relative URL](#status) and a
